# TicTacToe-In-SystemVerilog
TicTacToe that uses a 5x5 grid with a 3x3 winning condition!

# Still in progress

This TicTacToe is made using SystemVerilog.
Works properly when testing in ModelSim using the testbenchs provided.
Although this works in simulation it has not been successful on our Altera DE2 FPGA Board.



I plan to work on this in the future to make it work in hardware. 
If you would like to contribute the first step I would take a look at is the FSM.
